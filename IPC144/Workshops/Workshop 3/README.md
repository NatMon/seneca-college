# Lab 3 - Battle Scene - Logics

In this workshop, we will continue our development of a text based game "Code Quest!". This workshop focuses on retrieving input from the user, selecting from multiple logic paths based on user input and looping until some kind of condition is met.

### LEARNING OUTCOMES

Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will be able to 
- Write menus to interact with the user
- Use user input to determine which conditional path to use
- Use loops to repeat a set of operations until a goal is complete

### PART 1:

### SPECIFICATIONS

In this lab you are going to create a program `w3.c`, you are going to simulate a battle between a player and an enemy.
- Create player stat variables for Strength, Defense, Intelligence, and HP and initialize them as 10, 20, 40, and 10 respectively.
- Create enemy stat variables for Strength, Defense, Intelligence, and HP and initialize them as 30, 40, 25, and 10 respectively.
- Display "**Battle Start!**" and begin the battle sequence (below).
- Display to the user the current HPof the player and the enemy.
- Display a menu to the user with the attack options and accept the input from user (either '1' or '2')
- Option 1: If the user selects '1' (attack):
